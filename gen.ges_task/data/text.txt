py5 is a new version of Processing for Python 3.8+. It makes the Java
Processing jars available to the CPython interpreter using JPype. It can do
just about everything Processing can do, except with Python instead of Java
code. The goal of py5 is to create a new version of Processing that is
integrated into the  Python ecosystem. Built into the library are thoughtful
choices about how to best get py5 to work with other popular Python libraries
like NumPy or Pillow.
